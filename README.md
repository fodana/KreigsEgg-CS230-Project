# Product Name
KreigsEgg

KreigsEgg is an online marketplace that brings buyers and sellers of computer components and accessories together. Using KreigsEgg as a seller, users can upload photos and details of the computer components that they wish to sell. As a buyer, users can browse a listing page that contains all of the components sellers have posted. Users can use the search function to show only the type of components they are interested in purchasing. KregisEgg is only responsible for setting up a potential deal between buyers and sellers. This means that all transactions occur outside of KreigsEgg. In order to accomplish this, buyers can view items they wish to purchase and then send the seller of that item their own contact information they provided at sign up.
